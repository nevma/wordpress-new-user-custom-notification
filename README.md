# WordPress New User Custom Notification

Usually, when a WordPress Gravity Form contains file upload fields (single or multiple), then, when this form is submitted by front-end users, the files which have been uploaded along with the form are kept in a directory inside the WordPress installation. With this plugin they will also be included as email attachments into the notification emails that have been configured for each form. 



## Installation
